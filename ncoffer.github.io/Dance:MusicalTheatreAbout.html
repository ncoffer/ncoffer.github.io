      <p> I have so many inspirations. Alvin Ailey, Paula Abdul, Travis Wall, and Misty Copeland are just a mere few that I can name off the top of my head that have truly inspired me as a dancer and as a performer.
      There are so many performers that have gone through torn ACL's, had surgeries, and perhaps more than I can't even imagine to give an audience the performance of their life.
      As a dancer, choreographer, and performer, I respect all that have come before me and hope to make them and myself proud.

       <p> I've been dancing ever since I could walk. It has always been a passion of mine. To move and express oneself 
      through an art that is built on the past but is also always open to what the future brings is something I want to be a part of.
      While I grew as a performer, I also ventured farther out of my comfort zone and found musical theatre. Incorporating dance, acting, and singing together is absolute genius in my opinion.</p>
      <p>Musical theatre wise, I have taken part of my high school's renditions of 'Young Frankenstein' and 'Chicago'. Soon I will be taking part of my high school's rendition of 'Footloose'.
      As for dance, I have taken part in numerous dance shows with my dance studio, Sherrie's Dance Studio, since I was four. However, I have also taken part in my school's dance concert last fall. I plan to continue doing the dance concerts at my school and still take part at my dance studio.
