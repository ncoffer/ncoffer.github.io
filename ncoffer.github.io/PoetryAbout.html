      <h1>Inspiration</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">"Legacy is not leaving something for people. It's leaving something in people" - Peter Strople</h5>

      <p>On April 10, 2011, this quote took full effect. My Granny, Martha, had died after years of fighting breast cancer. My Granny had a lot of spirit and spunk.
      Her favorite Bible scripture was Psalm 27 and her words of Wisdom were "Don't Quit". As she left me with a lot of things to cross off our bucket list, I took it upon myself to continue her legacy that was brought to me as a teenager. Photography.
      I remember seeing my Granny always having her camera around her neck and never thought twice about it. However, since I've gotten my hands on that camera I haven't been able to stop taking pictures. I guess it runs in the family.</p>

      <h1>My Style</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">"Style is a reflection of your attitude and your personality" - Shawn Ashmore</h5>

      <p>I use photography to try to grasp the worlds I live in the way I understand best. With this I use a single lense to capture a million different views I never thought possible. Photography makes me take myself apart in order to become a blank slate. From there I am shaped with passion behind the lense by what I capture in front of the lense.</p>

     <p>Taking many perspectives of photography, I aspire to draw out emotions from the viewer. Using an unedited photo or a photoshopped image, I, as an artist, want to invoke memories that have been put aside and even close the gap between those who see with their eyes and those who see with their hearts.</p>
